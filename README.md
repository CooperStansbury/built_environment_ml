# built_environment_ml

## Overview

This repository is to organize progress on our built-environment research. We will keep each processing step as a separate utility (directory). Inside each folder we will have (1) A readme explaining what that utility does and how, (2) a `__main__.py` that allows the tools to be used from the command-line, and structures default arguments. (3) various `.py` files for managing logics, processes, ect.
